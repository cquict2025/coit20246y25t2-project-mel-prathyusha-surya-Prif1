## Reflection on Group Work
Progress was slowed due to difficulties in aligning schedules.
 •	Team members had varying skill levels, which required extra time to learn new tools or tasks.

Suggestions to Improve Future Collaboration:
 •	To keep everyone on the same page, holding short daily meetings helps track progress and fix issues early. This boosts team accountability and efficiency.
 •	Using tools to automatically track tasks helps avoid missing important work and flags delays early, keeping the team organized and deadline-aware.
 •	Setting up a clear Git branching plan lets members work separately without disrupting each other’s changes. It keeps version control smooth and avoids merge problems.
 •	Cloud-based tools for documentation ensure everyone can see the latest updates anytime, reducing confusion and helping the team work better together
